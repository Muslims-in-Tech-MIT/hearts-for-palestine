# Hearts for Palestine

Hearts for Palestine is a humanitarian project aimed at raising funds for our fellow brothers and sisters in Palestine.
Our mission is to shed light on the bitter realities faced by Palestinians and inspire acts of charity and generosity to help alleviate their suffering. Through donations, we hope to provide essential resources such as food, shelter and medical aid, thereby nurturing hope and resilience within their communities.

# Contribution guidelines

If you're committing changes to this repo for the first time, copy/paste the following commands when you're making your first commit:

```bash
git checkout -b "your-name/feature"
git add .
git commit -m "feature: <your-feature's name>"
git push --set-upstream origin "your-name/feature"
git checkout main
```

REPLACE `your-name/feature` with your name and the feature you're adding

If it's not your first commit in the repo, use `git push` rather than `git push --set-upstream origin your-name/feature`

Then head over to the GitHub repo online and create a pull request from the branch you just created.

After the first commit, you don't need to copy/paste the above again, you can make commits as usual.
